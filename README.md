### Miguel Ramos ðŸ‘‹

Frontend Engineer with a proven ability to deliver robust, effective products in collaborative settings under strict and often tight time constraints.  As an effective team member, I collaborated with numerous stakeholders to design and develop an ecommerce website for a cannabis company which generates over $1.2M in revenue annually.  Always seeking technical upskilling and personal growth, I expanded my coding acumen through a 1,000+ hour coding Bootcamp focused on JavaScript and React to improve my frontend engineering skill set. I am now eager to apply these valuable skills to obtain a challenging position on a collaborative development team focused on creating high-quality, intuitive front-end applications.
